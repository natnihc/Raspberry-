This project focuses on developing a light-controlled LED system using a Raspberry Pi and a Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR). The primary objective is to create an adaptable setup where the LED's brightness is dynamically adjusted based on ambient light conditions. The hardware configuration integrates an LDR and an LED into the Raspberry Pi ecosystem. A Python script interfaces with the GPIO pins to capture real-time light data from the LDR. The system then modulates the LED's brightness to match the detected light intensity, making it dimmer in bright conditions and brighter in the dark. This project has practical applications in energy-efficient lighting and serves as a foundation for more complex light-responsive systems in home automation, smart lighting, and industrial control.
